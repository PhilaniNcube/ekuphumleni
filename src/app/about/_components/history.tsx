            Ekuphumleni Joe Slovo Community Projects emerged from a profound concern for the widespread unemployment, poverty, crime, and various social issues plaguing the Joe Slovo community. Our founder envisioned a solution and inspired a group of dedicated women to turn a local dumping site into a vibrant vegetable garden. This initial project not only produced fresh vegetables for community members but also sparked a broader mission. We researched land ownership, secured a 99-year lease with CPA, and began laying the groundwork for a permanent structure to house our growing initiatives.
